## What is Semantic Provenance?

In the context of bioinformatics, **semantic provenance** refers to the *meaning* of data transformations, rather than the specific code or commands used to execute them. It answers questions like:

*   What biological assumptions were made? (e.g., reference genome version, library preparation method)
*   What was the scientific intent of a transformation? (e.g., normalization, filtering)
*   Is this dataset comparable to another?

This is in contrast to traditional workflow management systems, which primarily track **execution provenance**:

*   What script was run?
*   What were the command-line arguments?
*   What was the exit code?

## Why are Workflow Engines Insufficient?

Workflow engines like Nextflow, Snakemake, and Cromwell are excellent for managing the *execution* of pipelines, but they do not capture the *semantic meaning* of the data they produce. A file name like `normalized.tsv` tells you nothing about *how* it was normalized or *why*.

TRACE-SEQ is not a workflow engine. It is a complementary tool that layers semantic information on top of the files generated by your existing workflows.

## How TRACE-SEQ Differs from Metadata

While TRACE-SEQ does store metadata, it is structured and validated against a fixed ontology. This ensures that all provenance information is consistent, comparable, and machine-readable. It is not a free-form collection of notes, but a rigorous, verifiable chain of semantic states.
