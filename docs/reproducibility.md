# Reproducibility with TRACE-SEQ

Scientific reproducibility is a cornerstone of research. TRACE-SEQ helps to ensure reproducibility by providing a clear, verifiable, and machine-readable record of the semantic transformations that a dataset has undergone.

## How TRACE-SEQ Enhances Reproducibility

*   **Explicit Assumptions:** By forcing the user to declare assumptions at each step, TRACE-SEQ makes hidden dependencies and potential sources of variation explicit.
*   **Cryptographic Lineage:** The use of cryptographic hashes ensures the integrity of the provenance chain. Any change to a file or its history will be immediately detectable.
*   **Semantic Comparability:** The `trace-seq diff` command allows researchers to quickly determine if two datasets are semantically comparable, even if they were generated by different pipelines or at different times.

## A Practical Example

Consider two researchers who have both normalized their RNA-seq data. Researcher A used TPM normalization, while Researcher B used FPKM. A simple file comparison would show that the data is different, but it wouldn't explain *why*.

With TRACE-SEQ, the `trace-seq diff` command would immediately highlight the difference in the `normalization` step, providing a clear explanation for the discrepancy. This allows for more informed comparisons and helps to prevent erroneous conclusions.
