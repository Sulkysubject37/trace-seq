# TRACE-SEQ

**Minimal Semantic Provenance Tracking for Bioinformatics Pipelines**

TRACE-SEQ is a system for tracking the semantic provenance of data in bioinformatics pipelines. It is designed to be lightweight, cross-platform, and easy to use. TRACE-SEQ tracks the meaning of data transformations, not just the execution of code.

## Key Features

*   **Fixed Ontology:** All operations and assumptions are drawn from a predefined vocabulary, ensuring consistency and comparability.
*   **State-Based Provenance:** The semantic state of a dataset is tracked via cryptographic hashes, creating a verifiable lineage.
*   **Cross-Language Parity:** Core logic is implemented in C++, with interfaces in Python and R.
*   **Auditability:** Provenance is stored in human-readable YAML files, making it easy to inspect and audit.

## Getting Started

TRACE-SEQ is still under development. Please check back for updates.
